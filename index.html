                <h1>The "Bug"</h1>
                <h3>1800s | Misconceptions of the Terms Origin</h3>
                <p>a spurious account of the origin of the computer terms bug 'defect in hardware or software' and debug 'to eliminate such defects' is rapidly becoming the most popular item of etymological folklore of our time. The legend revices the term from an actual moth found inside an early computer by the pioneer computer scientitst Grace Murray Hooper.</p>
                <p>One day in the 1940s, Harvard's farmed Mark I - the precurous of todays comptuers - failed. When the Harvard scientists looked inside, theyfound a moth that had lodged in the Mark I's circuits. They removed the moth with a pair of tweezers, and form then o, whenever there was a problem with the Mark I, the scientists said they were looking for bugs. The term has stuch through the years.</p>
                <p>in some versions, the moth is said to have inspried the scientest to speak from then on of debugging the computer, with bug originating as a later back-formation from debug. THis moth has been popularized most widely by Jack B. Rochester and John Grantz's book, The Naked COmptuer(1983), but it has been repeated in many other publications as well.</p>
                <p>Based on various citations, the computer term bug was merely a specialized aplication of a general engineer term dating back from the 1800s</p>

                <h1>Physical Patches</h1>
                <h3>1890 | Punch Card Data Recording</h3>
                <p>Historically, software suppliers distributed patches on paper tape or on punched cards, expecting the recipient to cut out the indicated part of the original tape (or deck), and patch in (hence the name) the replacement segment.</p>
                <p>The original code used for punched card data recording in the 1890 census had 22 columns with 8 punch positions each (although there was room on the card for a total of 11 punch positions per column). The coding used on those cards did not encode data in columnar fields, but rather, each punch position was assigned a specific meaning. The need to store more data on each card led to higher density formats, first 24 colums of 10 positions each in the 1900 census (inferred from the 1900 National Geographic article), and then 27 columns of 12 positions each in the 1910 census. By the end of the 1920's, the standard format used 45 columns of round holes per card and 12 punch positions in each column.</p>

                <h1>ENIAC</h1>
                <h3>1946 | The First Computer?</h3>
                <p>The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC, was created under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert of Penn's Moore School of Electrical Engineering (now the School of Engineering and Applied Science).</p>

                <p>Construction of the 27-ton, 680-square-foot computer began in July 1943 and was announced to the public on Feb. 14, 1946. It was built to calculate ballistic trajectories for the Army during World War II, a time- and labor-intensive process that had previously been performed by teams of mathematicians working with mechanical calculators. ENIAC stored information in the form of electrons trapped in vacuum tubes, making it the first all-electronic, general-purpose digital computer. The long string of adjectives distinguishes it from earlier mechanical computers, which were essentially gear-driven abacuses that could aid in complex math but could only calculate a small subset of equations.</p>

                <h1>The Internet</h1>
                <h3>1950s-70s | Weapon to Civilian Utility</h3>
                <p>That the Internet partially owes its existence to the Cold War is well known.</p>
                <p>with the Soviet Union's successful launch of the Sputnik satellite in October 1957, an event that profoundly shocked the US defence establishment and led to the setting up of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) within the Department of Defense. Early in its organisational life, ARPA morphed into the agency within the Pentagon that funded advanced, ‘blue-skies’ research which could have military applications. In due course, ARPA found itself funding the purchase, operation, and maintenance of at least a dozen expensive mainframe computers for the various university departments and institutes which held research contracts from the agency.</p>
                <p>The idea of a ‘resource-sharing’ network first emerged in ARPA in 1966. Design work, conducted in a collegial style unusual in the defence industry, then proceeded over the next two years. The contract to build the network was awarded in early 1969 to Bolt, Beranek and Newman, a Boston-based consultancy firm with strong links to MIT. By 1972, the ARPANET network was essentially complete.</p>

                <h3>1970s-80s | Origin of the Personal Computer</h3>
                <p>There were many personal computers that came before it the most significant event of 1981 for the personal computing industry was the introduction of the IBM PC on August 12. This computer ran a 16-bit CPU on an 8-bit bus (the Intel 8088), had five expansion slots, included at least 16 KB of RAM, and had two full-height 5.25″ drive bays.</p>
                
                <p>Buyers could get a fairly loaded machine with a floppy controller, two floppy drives, a monochrome display adapter and 720 x 350 pixel green screen monitor, a color display adapter and CGA (320 x 200 with 4 colors or 640 x 200 with 2) monitor, a parallel card, a dot matrix printer, and an operating system – with the choice of CP/M-86, the UCSD p-System, or PC-DOS (a.k.a. MS-DOS). Pretty much everything was an option, and everyone recognized that the IBM PC was based on ideas perfected in the Apple II, particularly general use expansion slots.</p>

                <h1>Mobile Computers</h1>
                <h3>1980s-Present | Always On</h3>
                <p>In the early 1970s, technology had reached a point where the idea of a mobile phone was being bantered around. Prototypes were made, and the technology worked! The first set of wireless phones were added to luxury cars and train cars and other places where affluent people could take advantage of the technology. The in the 80s cellular technology began to improve, as did the form factors of mobile devices. In 1984, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X Advanced Mobile Phones System was introduced. The phone, which weighed in at a whopping 28 ounces, cost $4,000, and took 10 hours to charge for 30 minutes of talk time. Irregardless, the device, and others of that era had great demand. Motorola sold around 1,200 phones in 1984 alone; and, based on that success, innovation was priority number one.</p>

                <h1>Over The Air</h1>
                <h3>Present | Updates in the Background</h3>
                <p>OTA also known as Over The Air is a method through which updates are delivered to a wireless device(most probably smartphones). Ever since the first public release of Android in 2007, it has compatibility to download and install OS updates Over-the-Air (OTA), without requiring a physical connection to a computer, and the system has only gotten more robust since. Apple's iPhone did not begin using OTA update technology until 2011.</p>
                <p>Now, not only are the device's Operating Systems updated over the air, but the applications, services, and tools built into the phone are as well. This makes it easier than ever for software developers and engineers to modify, patch, or fix any aspect of the phone outside of hardware. A large amount of capatability is necessary is order to make the process run smoothly.</p>
                <p>This means that phones have to constantly be updated to a version of the OS that the company which distributes it serves. Outdted versions of mobile OSes are often depreciated, abandoned, and forgotten which basically bricks the device. as of right now, there is not a smart device that is separate from the major dominating OSes which can be practically used by consumers who many wish for alternatives.</p>
